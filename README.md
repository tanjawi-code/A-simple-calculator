### 🔨 Problem need to be fixed:
1. Showing decimals in the output. Example if you calculate (0.5 + 3), it's going to print 3 instead of 3.5 in output.
2. Fix the problem in result after calculating, and then you click two times or more in **equal button**.
3. Solve the problem of dividing on 0.

### 🔧 Improvements
* Add changing operators.
* Add showing result under where you calculate.
* Add a sound after clicking on buttons.
* Add showing operators.
* Make the program calculate more than 2 numbers.
